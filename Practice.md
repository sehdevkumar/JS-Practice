     2. How does `reduce` differ from `map` and `filter`? Provide examples.
     3. Write a function to flatten an array (`[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` → `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).
     4. Explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in arrays. 
     5. What happens if you modify an array during iteration with `forEach`?

---

### **2. Object-Oriented JavaScript**
   - **Topics**: Prototypes, `class`, `this`, inheritance.
   - **Questions**:
     1. Explain the difference between prototypal inheritance and ES6 classes.
     2. Implement a `customBind` function.
     3. What is the purpose of the `super` keyword in classes?
     4. How does `Object.create()` work?
     5. What is the difference between `hasOwnProperty` and `in`?

---

### **3. Closures and Scoping**
   - **Topics**: Lexical scope, closure, block vs function scope.
   - **Questions**:
     1. Explain closures and provide an example.
     2. What is the output of the following code?

        ```javascript
        function createCounter() {
            let count = 0;
            return function () {
                return ++count;
            };
        }
        const counter = createCounter();
        console.log(counter()); // ?
        console.log(counter()); // ?
        ```

     3. What’s the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
     4. How does JavaScript handle hoisting for variables and functions?
     5. Explain the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

---

### **4. Asynchronous JavaScript**
   - **Topics**: Promises, async/await, event loop, callbacks.
   - **Questions**:
     1. Explain the difference between `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`.
     2. What is the purpose of `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`?
     3. Write a polyfill for `Promise.all`.
     4. Explain how the event loop works in JavaScript.
     5. Write a function to debounce or throttle a given function.

---

### **5. Error Handling**
   - **Topics**: `try-catch`, custom errors, debugging.
   - **Questions**:
     1. How do you handle errors in Promises? Explain with an example.
     2. What is the difference between `throw` and `return` in error handling?
     3. How do you handle errors in `async/await`?

---

### **6. DOM Manipulation**
   - **Topics**: Events, `addEventListener`, bubbling, delegation.
   - **Questions**:
     1. Explain event delegation and provide an example.
     2. How would you implement a custom event emitter in JavaScript?
     3. What are the differences between `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events?

---

### **7. Advanced JavaScript**
   - **Topics**: Polyfills, design patterns, memory leaks, optimizations.
   - **Questions**:
     1. Implement `Function.prototype.customBind`.
     2. Explain the difference between `apply`, `call`, and `bind`.
     3. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
     4. How do you avoid memory leaks in JavaScript?
     5. Write a polyfill for `Object.assign`.

---

### **8. Module Systems**
   - **Topics**: CommonJS, ES Modules, imports/exports.
   - **Questions**:
     1. What is the difference between `require` and `import`?
     2. Explain how tree-shaking works in JavaScript.

### **10. Practical Exercises**
   - **Examples**:
     1. Write a function to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
     2. Write a function to debounce a search input.
     3. Create a function to merge two sorted arrays.
